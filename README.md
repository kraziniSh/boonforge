Curse CurseForge and their covalent bloatware!

**boonforge** is a CLI app for downloading CurseForge Minecraft modpacks.

# The New APIâ€™s Curse
[Overwolf | CurseForge are progressively rolling out their new API.](https://mailchi.mp/overwolf/whats-new-with-overwolf-curseforge-november3)

What this means for **boonforge**:
- development will continue until the old (current) API is destroyed
- we will request CurseForge for an API key and, depending on the outcome, boonforge development will continue...
- ...along with a ~bloat~ware version ðŸ‘€
