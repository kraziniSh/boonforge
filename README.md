# boonforge

Curse CurseForge and their covalent bloatware!

**boonforge** is a CLI app for downloading CurseForge Minecraft modpacks.

## It's BACK.

You probably didn't even hear about this tool at all. In that case, just know that things are going
back and forth.

## The New API's Curse

[Overwolf | CurseForge are progressively rolling out their new API.](https://mailchi.mp/overwolf/whats-new-with-overwolf-curseforge-november3)

What this means for **boonforge**:

- development will continue until they destroy the old (current) API
- we will request CurseForge for an API key and, depending on the outcome, boonforge development
  will continue...
- ...along with a ~~bloat~~ware version ðŸ‘€

## Installing

- Download the latest boonforge distribution
- Open a terminal in the `bin` directory
- **IF YOU DON'T HAVE JAVA ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SET UP:**

  implemented yet.**
- `boonforge [ARGS] --command [OPTIONS]`
